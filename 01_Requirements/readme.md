# REQUIREMENTS
## INTRODUCTION:
Basic Calculator ia a project which allow users to calculate the four basic operations in mathematics such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division but in this Project which I am implementing also includes three additional fundamental scientific operations such as calculating Factorial and Modulas operations. The inputs includes the commands which as we can give numbers based on the operation for example, in addition opoeration if we give 1 as a command and that particular operation works. However, this calculator is smart enough to operate multiplication / division before addition / subtraction / factorial / power / modulas, in another words it is implemented with the order of precedence logic.

## RESEARCH:
#https://www.phptpoint.com/write-a-c-program-to-design-a-calculator-using-switch-case/

The switch-case statement is used to write a simple calculator program in C language. The remainder operator (%) is normally used with data values. To print the remainder operator (%%) is used in the first printf() function. The variable (ch) store the operator, similarly the variables num1, and num2 stores the two numbers. The switch has condition (“ch”) so the entered operator is matched with which case label those case label statements are executed, and displays the result to the screen. If the entered operator is not matched with the case labels then the default statement will be executed and it will display the message depcting “Error! Invalid Operator.”
# SWOT ANALYSIS
## STRENGTHS

  The ultimate strength Calculators is its innovative,user-friendly and long lasting etc..

## WEAKNESSES

  Do not inlude all the operations rather have onlty addition,subtraction multiplication, division ,modulas ,power and factorial.

## OPPORTUNITIES

   The tech-based market has a huge opportunities in capturing the youth market. And this calculator comparatively already one step ahead than other

## THREATS

   The slower growth in technological innovation will also bring a significant threat in the upcoming dynamic world.
 
 
## WHO:
  The project can be used by almost all the people. At the end,user satisfaction is the goal of the project.
## WHAT:
  Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations can be performed by this system without manual usage of calculators.
## WHEN:
  This project can be used when the user needs or feels to perform a basic mathematical operation.
## WHERE:
  The calculator is an essential application in our day to day life. Schools, Organizations, Government organizations they all can use this application in their day to   day life activities for perfroming basic calculations.
